Abstract:
  
  A new, improved modified Newton Raphson (IMNR) load flow method is proposed for AC islanded microgrids. The absence of a strong slack bus and the droop control of distributed generation (DG) units pose challenges that can not be tackled by the conventional load flow techniques. The proposed load flow method extends the traditional Newton-Raphson technique to the islanded microgrid case with complex loads. The proposed load flow method has been tested on three different networks, and the performance of the proposed method has been compared with other methods. The IMNR method is fast and takes fewer iterations to converge. The proposed method is used to analyze the loadability of islanded microgrid, and the results are presented.
